- Data Types in Java
- Literals in Java
- Type Conversion (Implicit and Explicit)
- Assignment Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators

### Exercises:
1. **Primitive Data Types**: Create a program to demonstrate the use of all primitive data types and print their default values.
2. **Type Conversion**: Write a program that demonstrates implicit and explicit type conversion.

## Segment 1: Control Flow Statements
**Directory:** [Segment 1](segment1/)

### Topics Covered:
- If-Else Statements
- Switch Statements
- Loops (For, While, Do-While)
- Ternary Operator

### Exercises:
1. **Basic Calculator**: Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations using if-else and switch-case statements.
2. **Loop Patterns**: Write programs to print various patterns using loops.

## Segment 2: Object-Oriented Programming
**Directory:** [Segment 2](segment2/)

### Topics Covered:
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Multiple)
- Polymorphism (Method Overloading and Overriding)
- Encapsulation (Getters and Setters)
- `this` and `super` keywords

### Exercises:
1. **Bank Account Simulation**: Create a class `BankAccount` with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
2. **Inheritance Example**: Implement a simple inheritance hierarchy with classes like `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat`.

## Segment 3: Arrays and Strings
**Directory:** [Segment 3](segment3/)

### Topics Covered:
- Single and Multi-dimensional Arrays
- Jagged Arrays
- Array Operations
- String Manipulation
- Mutable vs Immutable Strings
- StringBuilder and StringBuffer

### Exercises:
1. **Array Sorting**: Write a program to sort an array of integers using different sorting algorithms.
2. **String Manipulation**: Create a program that reverses a string and checks for palindromes.

## Segment 4: Exception Handling and Multithreading
**Directory:** [Segment 4](segment4/)

### Topics Covered:
- Exception Handling (`try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`)
- Custom Exceptions
- Introduction to Threads
- Thread Life Cycle and States
- Synchronization and Race Conditions

### Exercises:
1. **Custom Exception**: Create a custom exception for handling invalid user input in a program.
2. **Thread Simulation**: Write a program to simulate a multi-threaded environment and demonstrate synchronization.

## Segment 5: Collections and Stream API
**Directory:** [Segment 5](segment5/)

### Topics Covered:
- Collection Framework (List, Set, Map)
- ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, TreeMap
- Comparator vs Comparable
- Stream API Basics
- Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions

### Exercises:
1. **Student Database**: Create a program that uses a `List` to store student records and allows operations like add, remove, and search.
2. **Stream API**: Use the Stream API to filter, map, and reduce a collection of data.
